\section{General Algorithm Description}\label{sec:general}

$\lambda$ is initial population size.
After each iteration algoritm maintains $\lambda$ individuals.
At the beggining of an iteration, $\mu$ best individuals are selected.
Next population is randomized in a way, so that result is similar (but different) to sampling $\lambda$ vectors with the mean $s$ and following covariance matrix:
\begin{equation}
    D' = \frac{1}{\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{\mu} (O_i - m)(O_i - m)^T,
    \label{eqn:equa1}
\end{equation}
where $O_i$ are individuals (vectors) from current populations, and $m$ is current population midpoint.
This is used in CMA-ES algorithm as covariance of covariance matrix a new population.
DES don't use this matrix directly to generate new vectors like CMA-ES.

To generate new individuals witch mean $s$ and new covariance matrix $D'$, we can use following formula:
\begin{equation}
    x = s + \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(O_i - O_j) + a\Delta
\end{equation}
where $s$ is midpoint of a population of best $mu$ individuals,
$O_i$ and $O_j$ are individuals selected independently with uniform distribution from the population of best $\mu$ individuals,
$a \sim N(0,1)$ is standardized scalar normal variate,
and $\Delta=s-m$.

DES algorithm modifies elements of this equasion.
Factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt2}$ is replaced with constant T, which is a parameter of the algorithm.
$O_i$ and $O_j$ are selected from best $\mu$ individuals of population $t-h$, where $t$ is current population number, and $h \sim U(0, ..., H-1)$
$H$ constant is a parameter of the algorithm.
$\Delta$ is accumulated shift of population midpoint
($\Delta(t+1) \leftarrow (1-c)*\Delta(t)+c*(s(t)-m(t))$).
$c$ is midpoint smootching factor.
Additionally DES adds to new individual a noise proportional to current $\Delta$.

To sum up, DES has 6 configurable parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\lambda$ - population size
\item $\mu$ - offspring number
\item $F$ - scaling factor
\item $c$ - midpoint smootching factor.
\item $H$ - time horizon for archive
\item $\epsilon$ - noise intensity
\end{enumerate}
