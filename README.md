# DEStrategy

An library which implements DES algorithm desribed in detail in [this article](https://pzawistowski.github.io/assets/wae/DES.pdf).

## Short DES algorithm description

$lambda$ is initial population size.
After each iteration algoritm maintains $lambda$ individuals.

At the beggining of an iteration, $mu$ best individuals are selected.

Next population is randomized in a way, so that result is similar (but different) to sampling $lambda$ vectors with following covariance matrix:
